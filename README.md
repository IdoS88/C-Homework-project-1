The project includes a C program that runs 3 different programs. first program called "Biggest Matrix Sum" takes an input of a big matrix and small matrix for initialization and generate a full numbers matrix. The program scan for the biggest sum of numbers found in the size of small matrix requested in the big matrix and print the results. The second program called "Color Game" is a automatic game which every color expands it's size in the available matrix slot. the game ends when there isn't an available color slot in the whole matrix.
